P1 = Republican (first state)
P2 = Republican (second state) 
p1 = sample in the first state 
p2 = sample in the second state 
The number sampled (n1) = 100 
The number sampled (n2) = 100
Mean of the difference of sample proportions: E(p1 - p2) = P1 - P2 = 0.52 - 0.47 = 0.05.

SD= sq{[P1(1 - P1)/n1] + [P2(1 - P2) / n2]}
SD= sq{[(0.52)(0.48)/100] + [ (0.47)(0.53) / 100]}
SD= sq(0.002496+0.002491) = sq(0.004987) = 0.0706
finding p1  < p2 or (p1 - p2) < 0, finding z-score of p1 - p2
z(p1-p2) = (x - Î¼(p1-p2)) / SD =(0 - 0.05)/0.0706 = -0.7082
z-score being -0.7082 or less=0.24. 
Resulting in show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state than the first state of 24%
